The Syndex Tumblr theme

I'm placing the code onto GitHub so that other users with programming knowledge can help improve the theme. A little background, I'm a designer first and an amateur coder second. I love coding, but as you'll see with this first draft, it's by no means as elegant and efficient as it could be. 
Since the theme is free to begin with, and easily clonable on Tumblr, I might as well share the code on a place designed for collaboration.

Let's see where this goes!
