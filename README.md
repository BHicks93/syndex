The Syndex Tumblr theme

I'm placing the code onto GitHub so that other users with programming knowledge can help improve the theme. 

A little background, I'm a designer *not* a programmer by any stretch of the imagination. I dabble and hack, and thank god for open source and plugins. So forgive the code you're about to see. This is part of the reason I want to GitHub this, hopefully contributors can help clean this up, improve it, and add there mark on the theme. With nearly 900,000 users and counting, your contributions will be appreciated by many.

Best,
